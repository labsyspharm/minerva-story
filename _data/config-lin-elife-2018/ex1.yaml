        These are unpublished 13-plex t-CyCIF images of tissue specimens from four patients with BRAF-mutant metastatic melanoma
        resected before (left) and after (right) treatment with BRAF and MEK inhibitors (dabrafenib/trametinib). Each
        image is composed of 150-200 image tiles at a resolution of ~0.9 μm. The `Tumor Architecture` markers represent
        tumor cells (`S100`), immune cells (`CD45`), and alpha smooth muscle actin in the stroma (α-`SMA`). Hoechst 33342
        labels `DNA` in cell nuclei. These specimens were retrieved from the archives of the Brigham and Women’s Hospital
        under a discarded/excess tissue protocol detailed in Institutional Review Board (IRB) protocol IRB17-1688 (2018)
        for research deemed to “involve no more than minimal risk to the subjects.”

        A low magnification view of the architecture of this __melanoma metastasis__ reveals _distinct compartments_-

        There is a compact nodule of melanoma tumor cells (`S100`+) which is surrounded by a dense collection of inflammatory cells (`CD45`+). A thin rim of `SMA` expressing fibroblasts surrounds the tumor nodule and the inflammatory cells.

        The melanoma tumor cells are highlighted by an antibody recognizing `S100` protein, an EF-hand calcium-binding protein that is expressed in neural crest derived cells such as melanocytes, Schwann cells, and glial cells as well as in tumors derived from these cells such as melanoma, schwannoma and glioma.

        S100 is also expressed in macrophages and dendritic cells which typically infiltrate between tumor cells.

        At the junction of the melanoma tumor nodule and the surrounding stroma, α-`SMA` highlights the pericytes (vascular smooth muscle cells) of small blood vessels and scattered tumor associated fibroblasts.  α-`SMA` also highlights the small blood vessels in the tumor nodule that are engulfed by `S100`+ melanoma cells. The dense band of `CD45` expressing immune cells can be seen at the tumor-stromal junction with scattered CD45+ immune cells also infiltrating the melanoma module.

      Description: | 
        Surrounding the tumor is a dense band of T cells (`CD3`+), many of which are `CD8` expressing cytotoxic cells.  A subset of the T cells are `FOXP3` expressing T regulatory cells (nuclear white signal).  

        While the FOXP3+ T regulatory cells infiltrate between the melanoma cells, most of the CD8+ T cells are excluded and are restricted to the surrounding band of immune cells.

      Description: | 
        There is widespread expression of `PD-L1` throughout the nodule in both tumor cells and tumor infiltrating macrophages. In the tumor nodule, `PD-1` expressing T cells are in close proximity to PD-L1 expressing cells. The relative proximity of PD-1 and PD-L1 expressing cells suggests a physical interaction, which is presumed to drive adaptive immune resistance. The interaction of PD-1 and PD-L1 expressing cells is accentuated at the tumor-stromal interface.

        There is a decrease in the amount of `PD-L1` expression in the tumor nodule with expression mostly localized to the region abutting the stroma, suggesting an effect of oncogenic signaling on PD-L1 expression and tumor immune surveillance.
