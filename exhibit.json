Here we display the specimen from her surgery. This patient does not carry any BRCA mutation.\n\nUpon inspection of the specimen, the patient was diagnosed with a Stage IIA high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). HGSOC was identified on her left fallopian tube, as well as her right ovary. Infiltrating cancer in the ovary will be shown in this specimen. \n\nThey also found pre-cancer lesions (serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma; STIC) on the left fallopian tube. Serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC) arises in the distal fimbriated end (Fimbriae) of the fallopian tube and likely represents a precursor lesion to HGSOC. Most STIC and HGSOC harbor TP53 mutation. \n\n## Metadata about this sample  \n\n### Diagnosis  \n**Age at diagnosis:**  62  \n**Primary diagnosis:**  HGSOC  \n**Surgery type:** bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) + hysterectomy  \n**Stage at diagnosis:** IIA  \n**Fallopian involvement:**  Yes; Left FT (STIC, HGSOC)  \n**Ovarian involvement:** HGSOC (right)    \n**Genetic features (BRCA):** WT  \n**Molecular features:** N/A  \n**Metastatic sites:** Left adnexa and anterior uterine serosa; uterus with focal complex endometrial hyperplasia with atypia, bordering on well-differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma  \n\n\n### Demographics  \n**Species:** Human  \n**Sex:** Female  \n**Race:**  \n**Ethnicity:**  \n**Age at Surgery:** 62 years  \n**Vital status at last follow-up:**  \n**Age at last follow-up:**  \n\n### Clinical history\n**Cancer history:** No cancer history   \n**Prior therapeutic agents:** Not applicable   \n\n### Therapy\n**Treatment type:** Post-surgical chemotherapy  \n**Therapeutic agents:**  Taxol/Carboplatin, Carbo/Doxil followed by Olaparib.
